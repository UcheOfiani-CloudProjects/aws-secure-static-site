# AWS Secure Static Website with Terraform

This project deploys a secure, highly available static website on AWS using **S3**, **CloudFront**, **Route 53**, and **ACM** — fully provisioned with **Terraform**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Host a static website using Amazon **S3**
- ✅ Secure it with **CloudFront CDN**
- ✅ Use **SSL/TLS** certificates from **AWS Certificate Manager**
- ✅ Attach a custom domain with **Route 53**
- ✅ Prevent public access to S3 via **OAC** (Origin Access Control)
- ✅ Use Terraform for **Infrastructure as Code**

---

## Architecture

- **S3**: Hosts static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **CloudFront**: Provides global CDN with HTTPS
- **ACM**: Manages the SSL certificate
- **Route 53**: Manages DNS records
- **OAC**: Ensures S3 content is only accessible via CloudFront

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── main.tf                      # Core resources (S3, CloudFront, etc.)
├── s3-website/
│   └── index.html               # Static site content
├── variables.tf                 # Input variables
├── outputs.tf                  # Outputs like website URL
└── terraform.tfvars            # Variable values
```


# Setup Steps
- Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory:

`git clone https://github.com/username/secure-static-site-terraform.git`

`cd secure-static-site-terraform`

# Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

# Review the Terraform configuration:
Open the main.tf and cloudfront.tf files to review the configuration. You can adjust any settings such as bucket names, region, or resources as needed.

# Run Terraform plan:
Generate an execution plan to review the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

```
`terraform plan`
```

# Apply the changes:
Apply the changes to create the AWS resources.

`terraform apply`

# Access your static site:
Once the terraform apply completes, Terraform will output the CloudFront URL where your static site is hosted. You can access it using this URL.

# Files
-main.tf: Contains the S3 bucket configuration and website deployment.
-cloudfront.tf: Contains the CloudFront distribution setup.
-variables.tf: Contains variables for S3 bucket name, region, etc.
-outputs.tf: Displays the URL of the CloudFront distribution.

### Issues Faced & How We Solved Them
Issue: Bucket name conflict
Cause: S3 bucket names are globally unique.
Solution: Appended a random_id to ensure uniqueness:
`bucket = "moe-static-site-${random_id.bucket_id.hex}"`

Issue: Access Denied on CloudFront
Cause: S3 bucket was private, and CloudFront didn't have permission.
Solution: Used `aws_cloudfront_origin_access_control` (OAC) and attached it to CloudFront.

Issue: HTTPS certificate not recognized
Cause: Certificate was not in us-east-1, which CloudFront requires.
Solution: Created ACM certificate in us-east-1 and referenced it in CloudFront.

### Output
After successful deployment, Terraform will output:
-Static website URL (CloudFront distribution)
-Bucket name
-Hosted zone ID (if Route 53 is included)

### Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Future Improvements

Add CI/CD deployment via GitHub Actions
Enable logging for CloudFront and S3
Add error page (e.g., 404.html)
